I am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Control Science and Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, under the guidance of Professor Gao Yue. I obtained my Bachelor’s degree from the Department of Automation at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I previously gained valuable experience in the field of DRL-based robot motion control. I'm motivated by the challenge of building truly practical Embodied Intelligence and am committed to pushing the boundaries of this field. I'm still on the road.
